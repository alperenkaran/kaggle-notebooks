This should be avoided, because it results in data leakage between train and test sets.*\n\n\n**Section 2:** I simply look at the dataset, and count the missing values.\n\n**Section 3 Part 1:** I create a binary classification task on an artificial dataset with two random features. Obviously, the accuracy should be around 50% since the random features are not informative about the class labels. When, furthermore, some values of a feature are set to `NaN` and imputed using the wrong way of imputation, the accuracies increased. This should not have happened. This demonstrates why that imputation method is wrong.\n\n**Section 3 Part 2:** Here, I do the same for the Water Potability task, and get around 71%.\n\n**Section 4:** I show how we can avoid data leakage between train and test sets. I do the model selection without using class labels of the test set.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Section 2: Read the Water Potability data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-10T11:37:46.853169Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-10T11:37:46.853597Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-10T11:37:47.803272Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-10T11:37:46.853497Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-10T11:37:47.802299Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/water-potability/water_potability.csv')\ndata.sample(3)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-10T11:37:50.226892Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-10T11:37:50.227247Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-10T11:37:50.29431Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-10T11:37:50.227212Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-10T11:37:50.293592Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-10T11:37:51.032677Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-10T11:37:51.033249Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-10T11:37:51.045306Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-10T11:37:51.033204Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-10T11:37:51.043811Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data has some missing values, and we would like to impute them using some strategies.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Section 3: What you shouldn't do when imputing missing values","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 1: Artificial dataset example","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let me first create an artificial dataset.
